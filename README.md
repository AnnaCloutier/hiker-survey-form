# Hiker Survey Form

This project is one of the requirements to earn my certification in Responsive Web Design from [FreeCodeCamp.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) After submitting basic code written in a [codepen.io](codepen.io) environment to pass FCC tests focused on web form elements, I wanted to be able to showcase a __complete__ project. I enhanced the page using my local environment with additional design elements to make the page responsive on mobile and desktop devices, added my own image, and some JavaScript.   

### *This project is focused on web forms and features:*
- Mobile-first design
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript to acheive simple DOM manipulation
- Simple use of Markdown syntax
- Complete and original coding project
